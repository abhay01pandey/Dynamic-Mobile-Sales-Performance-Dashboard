# Dynamic-Mobile-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This project showcases a comprehensive and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to monitor and analyze mobile phone sales. By providing a clear view of key sales metrics, market trends, and customer behavior, this dashboard serves as a vital tool for business leaders to make informed decisions. It enables stakeholders to optimize sales strategies, manage inventory effectively, and drive revenue growth in a competitive market.
# Project Overview
Situated with a large volume of mobile sales data, the Task was to create a unified dashboard that provides a holistic view of the business. Action was taken by cleaning and modeling the data, followed by building a multi-tab dashboard with interactive filters for brand, model, and payment method. The Result is a powerful analytics tool that helps identify top-performing products and brands, track sales over time, and compare current performance to previous periods.
# Key Features
 * Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Displays high-level metrics such as Total Sales, Total Quantity, Transactions, and Average Price.
 * Geographic Analysis: Visualizes sales performance across different cities, providing insights into regional market strength.
 * Time-Based Comparisons: Includes a dedicated tab to compare current year's sales performance against the same period last year by year, quarter, and month.
 * Product & Brand Insights: Ranks sales by brand (e.g., Apple, Samsung, OnePlus) and mobile model (e.g., iPhone SE, Galaxy Note 20) to identify top sellers.
 * Payment Method Analysis: Breaks down transaction volume by payment method (UPI, Debit Card, Credit Card, Cash), revealing customer payment preferences.
 * Customer Feedback Analysis: Provides insights into product ratings (Good, Average, Poor), helping to gauge customer satisfaction.
# Key Insights
 * The total sales for the period are a staggering $769 million from 19K units sold.
 * The average price of a mobile phone sold is $40.11K, with over 4K transactions.
 * Apple is the top-selling brand, generating the highest sales and transaction volume, followed closely by OnePlus and Samsung.
 * UPI and Credit Card are the most popular payment methods, indicating a strong preference for digital transactions.
 * The dashboard highlights a consistent upward trend in sales throughout the year.
 * Sales volume is highest on Fridays and Mondays, and lowest on weekends, suggesting a strong B2B component or Monday-morning consumer rush.
# Tools and Technologies
 * Microsoft Power BI (used for all data cleaning, modeling, and visualization)
 * Power Query (for data transformation)
 * DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
